          <h3>Joshua Lord</h3>
          <p><strong>About Joshua: </strong>Joshua started home brewing when his wife bought him a one-gallon brewing kit from Brooklyn Brew Shop when he was in graduate school at Georgia Tech. Keith helped with the first brew, and it took off from there. Joshua enjoys all things beer: books, magazines, TV shows, festivals...you name it! He has devoted almost all of his free time to learning about beer and growing the Snolligoster Homebrew Club. His favorite brewing experience is when he brewed a special barleywine for the day of his daughter Emerson's birth. He currently works as a Management Analyst for the state of Georgia and oversees all activities of the club.</p>

          <h3>Caleb Moore</h3>
          <p><strong>About Caleb: </strong>Caleb used to HATE beer, true story. Then one beautiful day the beer gods smiled down upon him and introduced him to Blue Moon. The rest they say, is history. He has been obsessed with all things beer ever since, and that was about four years ago. He is 26 and his passion has only grown stronger with each sip. Everywhere he travels, he seeks out local craft breweries to explore the many different styles of beer, and their unique taste. About two years ago, he decided to give home brewing a try with our President, Joshua Lord, and became addicted. However, at that time he did not realize how much patience one needs. Brewing beer is an art. It takes hard yet delicate work and determination to find that specific taste one is seeking.  He is trying to kickstart his career in beer any way possible. He currently works in the Tap room at Second Self Beer Company in Atlanta. Through Snolligoster Brew Club he hopes to gain more friendships and experience for that which he loves- BEER! Cheers!</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Beer: </strong>Jai Alai</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Styles: </strong>Changes monthly but overrall would have to be IPA </p>

          <h3>Cameron Goershel</h3>
          <!--Birthday: September 15-->
          <p><strong>About Cameron: </strong>Cameron was introduced to homebrewing by his father in 2010, who brewed throughout the 80s and 90s. He quickly caught "the bug" for brewing, and brewed regularly in Kennesaw before moving to Athens for graduate school. In Athens, Cameron worked at 5 Points Growlers & Homebrew Supply where he helped local homebrewers learn to brew, develop recipes, and grow their craft. Cameron was one of the original staff members of The Southern Brewing Company, maintaining the tasting room draft lines, working tours, and helping brew on the pilot system. Cameron currently works at the State Capitol and serves as the Vice President of Education for Snolligoster Brew Club. Cameron frequently gives a style profile or technical talk at the Snolligoster club meetings.</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Beer: </strong>Southern Brewing Company Broad Street Pale Ale</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Styles: </strong>American Pale Ale, English Porter, West Coast IPA</p>

          <h3>Alan Stanford</h3>
          <p><strong>About Alan: </strong>What’s up everybody! To be honest, Alan started coming to the Snollingoster brews just to hang out with good people. His beer knowledge has come a long way...but he still has a lot to learn. The more he comes to the brew club, the more he learns about what it takes to make the tastiness of beer. He will continue to ask a lot of questions and grow his knowledge of beer. Perhaps one day he will have a beard down to his shoelaces and wear flannel upon flannel. In the meantime, he’ll be the treasurer of the club.
            Outside of the brewery he enjoys doing triathlons and staying active. He currently works in the accounting department for Buildrite Construction in Kennesaw, GA.</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Beer: </strong>Smithwick’s Irish red ale</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Styles: </strong>Red ales</p>

          <h3>Keith Russ</h3>
          <p><strong>About Keith: </strong>Keith started home brewing in college with his father. Their home brews consisted mainly of extract homebrew kits, so he did not start all grain brewing until he began brewing with Josh. Though he had had craft beer since he was able to drink, the beer that really inducted him into the craft brew world was Palo Santo Marron by Dogfishhead Brewing. This beer made Keith want to search for more of that same experience, to see what the craft beer world could do. His favorite thing to do with brewing is to experiment with the oddest combinations and the most interesting flavor profiles possible.</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Beer: </strong>DogfishHead Palo Santo Marron</p>
          <p><strong>Favorite Styles: </strong>Pretty much anything with a higher ABV, Belgian Quads, BarleyWines, and Imperial anything</p>

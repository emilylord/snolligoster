    <h1>The Brew Club - A Wife's Perspective</h1>
    <p class="author">By Emily Lord &nbsp;|&nbsp; July 9, 2017 </p>
    <p>I guess I can say that I started all of this. I bought my husband, Josh, the founder of Snolligoster Brew Club, his first brew kit for Christmas a few years ago. Everyone thinks that I "ruined" Josh by getting him started on beer, but that I did <em>not</em> do! His first beer that he actually enjoyed was a couple of days after we started dating, but that's just a coincidence. Josh didn't start out liking beer because "beer" where Josh is from is a means to get drunk and usually means something like Bud Light (no hating on the ole BL, just saying that's what most people think of).</p>
    <p>Boy, that first brew was interesting. At this point we were in our first house, which was pretty small. We had most of the equipment needed in the kitchen (or so we thought). Josh and Keith were flying solo on this brew. It took close to 6 hours and I'm pretty sure every single bowl we owned was in use at some point. Thankfully, they cleaned it all up. After we moved back into an apartment, the brewing got pretty miserable. I was pregnant the whole time we were in this apartment, so the smell and the heat was particularly rough for me. Our A/C in the apartment sucked, so it was not unusual for the apartment to be 80 degrees on a brew day with the stove constantly going (and the oven when we were making frozen pizza) and the amount of people in there at one time. I was mostly antisocial and would lay on the couch and watch HGTV while the guys brewed.</p>
    <p>Finally, after our daughter was born, we moved into our current house in Marietta. The brew setup in this house is pretty sweet. We have an entire room in our basement dedicated to brewing equipment, as well has half of the finished part of the basement dedicated to beer. Now that the brew club has such great equipment and a huge area outside to brew, it only takes about 4 hours per session. I am <em>very</em> glad that we now have a full-sized fridge in the basement to keep the beer so that it's not infringing on my fridge in the kitchen!</p>
    <p>I am in a pretty interesting position as the wife of the founding and most active member of the brew club and as someone who does not enjoy beer. If I'm being honest - I could sip on a Bud Light or something similar and moderately dislike the first beer, and then not even be able to finish a second. I'm a wine drinker. So my position is interesting because this has taken over a huge part of my house and my life, and I can't even reap the benefits! Brew days for me usually consist of taking care of the baby and watching some TV if I can get it in. Thankfully, Josh pretty much lets me do my own thing on brew days and doesn't beg me to be outside with them. It is definitely hard to take care of the baby by myself for over half the day, but that's part of parenting. Brew days are not the only part of my life that has beer in it. A lot of my conversations with my husband revolve around beer, therefore, I know a ton about it. I could probably talk most people into the ground about beer, which is hilarious considering I don't even drink it!</p>
    <p>To say beer is my husband's hobby is an understatement. I think it is part of what defines his life. Therefore, even though I could not care less about beer, I am an active participant in the brew club activities and help Josh with what I can. I do wish it were different at times, since this hobby is so time-consuming, but it brings Josh a lot of joy. Anyone can sit around and drink, but Josh critically thinks about beer. He thinks about the science behind it. It has been crazy to see what that little 1-gallon brew kit from Brooklyn Brew Shop has turned into. One thing that the brew club has brought us is a really solid group of friends. Especially since we have a baby now, we probably wouldn't see our friends much if we didn't have the brew club. The brew days aren't strictly business, they're also an opportunity to get a good group of friends together to eat, talk, and play cornhole in the backyard.</p>

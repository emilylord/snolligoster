    <h1>History of Snolligoster Homebrew Club</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
<p>We are Snolligoster Brew Club and this is our fascinating story.  Before we begin, you’re probably wondering what a Snolligoster is and how this name came to be. There are actually two terms for this audacious word. First being Snollygoster, with two L’s and a Y, means a shrewd and unprincipled person.  Second, a Snoligoster, with one L and an I, a mythological monster that preys on unsuspecting lumber jacks in the Pacific Northwest.  We chose to combine a component of each of these spellings and definitions for our club. Our motto is, “Shrewd and Unprincipled,” much like our beers. Our choice of spelling and the major theme of our beers are based upon the monster.</p>
  <p>The history of our club is a funny one, being that two of the founding members HATED beer, yes you read that right. Beer was not our choice of drink, or any alcohol for that matter. Believe it or not Blue Moon changed our lives forever. It was the first “craft” beer that we enjoyed, and yes it did have an orange slice. Our love for beer has grown exponentially since then. After trying every type, variety, and style we could get our hands on our club president, Josh, decided he wanted to brew his own beer.</p>
  <p>Josh’s wife gave him his first 1-gallon brew kit as a gift for Christmas in 2014. Only one other member, Keith, helped him with the very first brew. It was an interesting experience to say the least. The brew was done in the kitchen using only cooking equipment that was already there. It took 5-6 hours and cleanup was a job in itself. It was a true learning experience and it’s great to think back to how far we’ve come since then.</p>
  <p>After that Josh became addicted and spread his newfound passion to friends. We will never forget the first few batches we brewed.  One that really stands out was when we started brewing around seven at night, not realizing how long the brewing process would take. Needless to say we finished around two in the morning.  Showing our true commitment to quality beer, we use to brew in an apartment on an electric stovetop, thanks Emily ☺. This made the brewing process SOOOO much longer than it should be.  Thankfully, we have moved our operation into a much better location here in Marietta.</p>
  <p>Now our club boasts a basement bar with a beer fridge and an entire room for equipment, a homemade kegerator, a 10-gallon kettle, a 15-gallon kettle, 8 carboys, 2 mash tuns, a homemade tiered brew system, and 2 torpedo kegs.</p>
  <p>Reflecting back on these experiences really shows how much of a passion for home brewing we have.  No matter what problem we faced, or how long a brew day was we had an amazing time together with our beer. Our club has now grown into ten members and has plenty of room to grow.</p>
